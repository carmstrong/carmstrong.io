          Hi! I'm <b>Chris Armstrong</b>. My call is to build community by pursuing <strong>depth</strong>, <strong>honesty</strong>, and <strong>vulnerability</strong> in all of my relationships.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Professional Bio</b><br>
          A seasoned leader of technical organizations at early- and growth-stage startups, I possess a unique combination of strengths: a passion for peoples' flourishing; an eye for usability with strong user empathy; and an instinct for effective product/market strategy.<br><br>
          I've crafted product and built engineering organizations from scratch at <a href="https://www.jazzhr.com/">JazzHR</a> and <a href="https://deis.com/">Deis</a>. I was intimately involved in company and product strategy from ideation to market, working closely with customers, users, and internal stakeholders. I specialize in building SaaS businesses, fostering community for open-source products, and spearheading sweeping company-wide cultural improvements.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm seeking an opportunity that plays to my unique strengths and more fully integrates my personal call with my vocation.<br>
          While I'm technical by training, I'm people-focused by passion and mission. The more original and creative the opportunity, the better!
        </p>

        <p>
            Please <a href="mailto:chris@chrisarmstrong.me?subject=Hi">reach out</a> if my mission resonates with you - I'd love to chat!
        </p>
